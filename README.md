<h1>Case Study: Geneva Wheel Assembly Design Project</h1>

  <h2>Objective:</h2>
    <p>The objective of this system modeling and manufacturing project was to apply and demonstrate knowledge of common
        mechanical elements, components, and principles. Specifically, the goal was to design a Geneva Wheel assembly using
        CATIA V5, incorporating a precise mechanism that accurately predicts one-minute intervals. This project aimed to
        assess the understanding of system modeling, mechanical engineering design, and manufacturing principles.</p>
